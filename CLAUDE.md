## Content Format

- All documentation is written in Korean
- Files are Markdown (`.md`) with conceptual explanations, syntax examples, and best practices
- Algorithm examples use Java with competitive programming style (BufferedReader, StringTokenizer)

## Adding New Content

When adding new study notes:
1. Place files in the appropriate topic directory
2. Use Korean for topic subdirectory names (e.g., `기초/`, `객체지향/`)
3. Follow the existing Markdown structure with headers, code blocks, and examples
